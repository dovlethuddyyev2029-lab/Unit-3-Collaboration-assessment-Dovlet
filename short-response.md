Q1: You need to save your work for what you need in the branch 
Q2: they use branches to complete work faster without touching the main branch
q3: git is a distributed version control system that every developer can use.  github is a cloud space that allows developers to store their data, track, manage and control changes to their code. They work together because git allows you to see the changes you made and github saves that work.
q4: the git commit -m "svaing work" should go after git add .     so the correct sequence is 
git add .
git commit -m "saving work"
git push
